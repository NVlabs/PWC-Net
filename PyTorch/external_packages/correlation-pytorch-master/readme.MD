This repository contains a custom pytorch package that adds a module and functional interface for the correlation layer described in "FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852)

To install:

1. Run `make_cuda.sh`
2. (optional) Run `python test/test.py`


#### Acknowledgement
- Thanks to Dr. Fitsum Reda for providing the wrapper to the correlation code
