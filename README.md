### Usage

For Caffe users, please refer to [Caffe/README.md](Caffe/README.md).

For PyTorch users, please refer to [PyTorch/README.md](PyTorch/README.md)

The PyTorch implementation almost matches the Caffe implementation (average EPE on the final pass of the Sintel training set: 2.31 by Pytorch and 2.29 by Caffe). 

### Network Architecture

PWC-Net fuses several classic optical flow estimation techniques, including image pyramid, warping, and cost volume, in an end-to-end trainable deep neural networks for achieving state-of-the-art results.
